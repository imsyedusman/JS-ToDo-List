# JS-ToDo-List
This is a simple Todo List app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add and delete tasks, and uses local storage to save the tasks even after the page is refreshed. This project helped me learn how to manipulate the DOM, use local storage, and handle events in JavaScript.
